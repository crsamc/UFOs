# UFO_Challenge
## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results

The filter allows you to get specific information based on date, city, state, country, and shape. You can be as specific as you choose based on the information you are wanting.

To do a search. You would type the information you are looking for in the sesrch field for the respective category. It must be typed in lowercase letters and date specific to M/DD/YYYY format. 
The example below shows the information filtered to all sightings in the state of Florida.

## Summary
- One drawback of this webpage
1. The search bars are specific to lower case letters, should be able to type in any case. Also, would be nice to have the filters activate while typing, just in case of spelling errors.

- Two additional recommendations for further development
1. Add a date range option rather than specific day.
2. Addition of global sightings to the data.
